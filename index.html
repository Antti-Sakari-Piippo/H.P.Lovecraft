            <h3>Early Life</h3>
            <p>
              H.P. Lovecraft was born in 1890, in Providence, Rhode Island. The
              horror magazine Weird Tales bought some of his stories in 1923.
              His story "The Call of Cthulhu" came out in 1928 in Weird Tales.
              Elements of this story would reappear in other related tales. In
              his Lovecraft was born Howard Phillips Lovecraft in 1890, in
              Providence, Rhode Island. Lovecraft had an unusual childhood
              marked by tragedy. His traveling salesman father developed a type
              of mental disorder caused by untreated syphilis when he was around
              the age of three. In 1893, his father became a patient at the
              Butler Hospital in Providence and there he remained until his
              death in 1898. years, he took editing and ghostwriting work to try
              to make ends meet. He died on March 15, 1937, in Providence, Rhode
              Island.
            </p>
            <p>
              A sickly child, Lovecraft spent many of his school years at home.
              He became an avid reader, devouring works on a variety of texts.
              Lovecraft loved the works of Edgar Allan Poe and developed a
              special interest in astronomy. As a teenager, he did attend Hope
              High School, but he suffered a nervous breakdown before he could
              earn his diploma. Lovecraft became a reclusive figure for several
              years, choosing to stay up late studying and reading and writing
              and then sleeping late into the day. During this time, he managed
              to publish some articles on astronomy in several newspapers.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col">
            <h3>Writing Career</h3>
            <p>
              Lovecraft started out as a would-be journalist, joining the United
              Amateur Press Association in 1914. The following year, he launched
              his self-published magazine The Conservative for which he wrote
              several essays and other pieces. While he had reportedly dabbled
              in fiction early on, Lovecraft became more serious about writing
              stories around 1917. Many of these early works were influenced by
              the writings of Lord Dunsany, an Irish author of fantasy tales, as
              well as Lovecraft's early favorite Edgar Allan Poe.
            </p>
            <p>
              The horror magazine Weird Tales bought some of Lovecraft's stories
              in 1923, giving him his first taste of literary success. The
              following year, he married Sonia Greene. The couple lived together
              in New York City for two years before splitting up. After his
              marriage failed, Lovecraft returned to Rhode Island and began work
              on some of his best stories. "The Call of Cthulhu" came out in
              1928 in Weird Tales, and it perhaps best illustrated Lovecraft's
              efforts at creating an otherworldly type of terror.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since his death, Lovecraft has earned greater acclaim than he
              enjoyed during his lifetime. He has been an inspiration to such
              writers as Peter Straub, Stephen King and Neil Gaiman. His stories
              have also served as the inspiration for numerous films, including
              2011's Hunters of the Dark and 2007's Cthulhu. As King explained
              to American Heritage magazine, "Now that time has given us some
              perspective on his work, I think it is beyond doubt that H.P.
              Lovecraft has yet to be surpassed as the twentieth century's
              greatest practitioner of the classic horror tale."

        <h2>The Most Iconic Works of H.P.Lovecraft</h2>
        <div class="works__columns">
          <div class="col">
            <h3>The Call of Cthulhu</h3>
            <p>
              The Call of Cthulhu is probably Lovecraft’s most influential
              story, serving as the basis for his epic “Old Ones” mythos. It
              centers around an ancient dragon-sea monster hybrid that implants
              itself subconsciously into human minds, driving them slowly
              insane. The cultists who worship Cthulhu commit ritual killings
              and chant in tongues. As more details of the creature and its
              history come to light, our narrator realizes that no one can
              possibly be safe from such a powerful entity — not even himself.
            </p>
            <p>
              This eerie work of masterful suspense heads up one of the best
              H.P. Lovecraft books of all time, but it’s by no means the only
              worthy piece in this anthology! Included among these “weird
              stories” are seventeen other tales of the mad, mystical, and
              macabre, each taking a slightly different approach to horror. The
              Rats in the Walls is a Tell-Tale Heart-esque account of a man
              who’s plagued by the sound of rats in his family home. However,
              when he goes to investigate, he uncovers a gruesome truth about
              his ancestors. Dagon is the testimony of a World War I vet who
              relies on morphine to ease his tortured mind… but the visions that
              haunt him are worse than any battlefield violence.

            <h3>The Shadow Over Innsmouth</h3>
            <p>
              The Shadow Over Innsmouth follows Robert Olmstead, a man who
              becomes fascinated by the mysterious (sadly fictional) New England
              hamlet of Innsmouth. As Olmstead embarks on a tour of the town —
              having heard vague, superstitious warnings from outsiders — he
              detects something strange about its citizens. Most of whom walk in
              an odd shambling manner and have unusual facial features,
              including flat noses and “bulgy, stary eyes.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Olmstead meets an old townie called Zadok Allen, who provides an,
              er, interesting explanation for the town’s peculiarities: that its
              human inhabitants have devoted themselves to a brutal race of
              fish-like humanoids known as the “Deep Ones,” who have forced
              humans to breed with them. Those walking the streets of Innsmouth
              are the resulting offspring — as they mature, they will grow to
              resemble the Deep Ones, eventually joining them in their
              underwater cities.
            </p>
            <p>
              Naturally, Olmstead dismisses Zadok’s ramblings. But when the old
              man disappears soon after, our hero realizes that he could be
              next… though at the hands of humans or monsters, he can’t be sure.
              This gloriously unsettling tale is also another foundational work
              of Lovecraft’s mythos, introducing the ideas of the Deep Ones (a
              subset of the Old Ones) and the “Esoteric Cult of the Dragon” that
              began the practices of worship in Innsmouth.
            </p>

          <div class="col">
            <h3>The Whisperer in Darkness</h3>
            <p>
              In this novella, literature professor Albert A Wilmarth (you’ll
              notice that many of Lovecraft’s protagonists have such formal
              names and scholarly professions — likely in homage to the
              characters of M.R. James) becomes involved in a controversy
              surrounding strange, seemingly extraterrestrial sightings. A man
              of logic, Wilmarth naturally sides with skeptics, who claim the
              “sightings” stem from local legends with no factual basis. But
              after receiving a letter from one Henry Wentworth Akeley, a fellow
              academic, Wilmarth opens his mind to the possibilities of
              extraterrestrial life — only to find that he never should have
              gotten involved.
            </p>
            <p>
              The chilling meditation on science and belief certainly says as
              much about humanity than it does about about any possibility of
              alien life, and Wilmarth’s revelations are sure to leave you
              reeling. If you’re more into message than monsters, this is the
              Lovecraft story for you. Though we will say there’s no lack of
              disquieting imagery, including one of the earliest incidents of
              “brain in a jar”.
            </p>

          <div class="col">
            <h3>The Dunwich Horror</h3>
            <p>
              Lovecraft loved him a fictional New England town full of
              inexplicable phenomena. The Dunwich Horror follows the development
              of Wilbur Whateley, a child who matures at a freakish rate,
              becoming a full-grown man in just a few years. His grandfather,
              Old Whateley, takes Wilbur under his wing, as Wilbur’s mother is
              crippled and unstable and his father is mysteriously absent. Old
              Whateley teaches Wilbur the ways of dark sorcery and witchcraft;
              the locals fear and avoid them. However, they do take note of the
              odd circumstances surrounding the Whateleys’ cattle, which
              occasionally disappear.
            </p>
            <p>
              What single thread runs through all of this bizarre horror?
              Something even more disturbing than readers might anticipate. This
              story is a rattling precursor to The Shadow Over Innsmouth,
              written a couple years later, which would bring Lovecraft’s ideas
              about human-monster spawn to full fruition. The Dunwich Horror
              also prominently features the “Necronomicon,” a critical text in
              H.P. Lovecraft books that frequently appears in connection with
              the Old Ones.
            </p>

          <div class="col">
            <h3>At the Mountains of Madness</h3>
            <p>
              Another classic Lovecraft novella, and probably his best-known
              work after Cthulhu, At the Mountains of Madness describes a failed
              (to put it lightly) Antarctic expedition as recounted by Professor
              William Dyer. Upon arriving at their base, Dyer and his colleagues
              are thrilled to unearth the remains of a previously undiscovered
              prehistoric species — some specimens of which are in perfect
              condition. However, their excitement soon turns to terror as they
              realize that these “specimens” may not be so lifeless after all.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the Mountains of Madness is one of the primary expository works
              about the Old Ones, here dubbed the “Elder Things” by the
              explorers as they stumble upon more and more evidence. For
              instance, Dyer and another colleague discover the remains of
              massive, inhuman architecture, along with etchings that explain
              the evolution of the Elder Things and imply their eventual
              migration into the ocean.
            </p>
            <p>
              Indeed, this story a prime example of Lovecraft’s skillful
              worldbuilding, creating a sense of vivid dread through this mythos
              that seems so detailed, it must be true — especially with so many
              elements tying seamlessly into his other works.
            </p>

          <div class="col">
            <h3>The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath</h3>
            <p>
              Now we’re getting into the “Dream Cycle,” a series of works in
              which Lovecraft explores the supernatural through dreams and the
              subconscious. The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath features Randolph
              Carter, a scholar and antiquarian driven to explore the
              “Dreamlands”: an alternate dimension accessible only via dreams.
            </p>
            <p>
              Carter has already dreamt several times of a majestic city on the
              horizon which he’s never been able to get close to. He wants to
              ask the dream gods to help him — but to do that, he’ll first have
              to find Kadath, where they reside. Carter must navigate the
              uncharted terrain and interact with the many strange inhabitants
              of the Dreamlands, never quite sure who wants to help and who
              would rather hurt him.
            </p>
            <p>
              From the feline-filled city of Ulthar (where the only law is that
              no one may kill a cat) to the onyx nation of Inganok, Kadath truly
              does mimic the atmosphere of our most random dreams. Of course it
              wouldn’t be Lovecraft without constant ominous warnings for Carter
              to abandon his quest, but overall, this novella is more
              fantastical than frightful. If you loved A Wrinkle in Time or
              Prince Caspian, you’ll enjoy this similarly imaginative journey.
